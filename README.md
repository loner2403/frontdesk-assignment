## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a **human-in-the-loop AI supervisor system** for a simulated salon. The system allows an AI agent to handle customer queries, escalate to a human supervisor when needed, and continuously learn from supervisor responses. It is designed for reliability, modularity, and extensibility, and demonstrates best practices in full-stack engineering.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time customer-agent communication (LiveKit)
- Escalation to human supervisor for unknown queries
- Supervisor/admin panel for managing help requests and knowledge base
- Persistent knowledge base that grows with supervisor input
- Room event tracking for auditability

## 2a. Deep Technical Architecture Overview

### System Architecture (Technical Deep Dive)

#### Component Breakdown
- **Client App (React 19, TypeScript):**
  - Handles customer chat UI, session management, and LiveKit real-time communication.
  - Communicates with backend via REST API and LiveKit WebSocket.
  - State managed via React hooks and context; error/loading states handled at component level.
- **Admin App (React 19, TypeScript):**
  - Supervisor dashboard for help requests, knowledge base, and room event logs.
  - Uses REST API for CRUD operations and LiveKit for real-time updates (future: WebSocket for push updates).
- **Backend/API (Node.js, Express, TypeScript):**
  - REST API endpoints for agent, supervisor, help requests, knowledge base, and room events.
  - Business logic in `src/services/`, event-driven decoupling via `src/eventBus.ts`.
  - Integrates with LiveKit via API and WebSocket for real-time room management.
  - Uses Prisma ORM for database access and migrations.
- **Database (PostgreSQL, Prisma):**
  - Stores help requests, knowledge base, and room events.
  - Enforces data integrity and transactional writes.
- **LiveKit (Cloud or Self-hosted):**
  - Provides real-time audio/video/data channels for chat rooms.
  - Backend authenticates and manages rooms, participants, and event logging.

#### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, CSS Modules
- **Backend:** Node.js 18+, Express, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (local or managed)
- **Real-time:** LiveKit Cloud (WebSocket, REST API)
- **DevOps:** `.env` for config, Prisma migrations, npm scripts

```

### Data Flow

#### Help Request Lifecycle
1. **Customer submits question** via Client App â†’ POST `/api/agent/message`.
2. **Backend (Agent Service):**
   - Checks knowledge base for answer (fuzzy match).
   - If found, responds immediately.
   - If not, escalates:
     - Creates `HelpRequest` in DB (status: pending).
     - Notifies supervisor via Admin App (polling or future: WebSocket push).
3. **Supervisor (Admin App):**
   - Views pending requests, submits answer via `/api/help-requests/:id/reply`.
   - Backend updates `HelpRequest` (status: resolved), creates/updates `KnowledgeBaseEntry`.
   - Notifies original customer via LiveKit room event.
4. **Room Events:**
   - All join/leave/message events logged in `RoomEvent` table for auditability.

#### Knowledge Base Update
- When supervisor answers, backend stores Q&A in `KnowledgeBaseEntry`.
- Future similar questions are auto-answered by agent using fuzzy search.

#### Real-Time Communication
- LiveKit rooms are created per help session.
- Client, agent, and supervisor join as participants.
- Messages and events are exchanged via LiveKit DataTracks and logged.

### Control Flow

#### Escalation Logic
- If agent cannot answer (no KB match, low confidence), triggers escalation:
  - Creates help request (pending).
  - Notifies supervisor.
  - Sets timeout for supervisor response (configurable, e.g., 2 minutes).
- If supervisor responds in time:
  - Marks request as resolved, notifies customer, updates KB.
- If timeout:
  - Marks request as unresolved, notifies customer, logs event.

#### Error Handling & Reliability
- All API routes use async error handlers (try/catch, Express middleware).
- Database/network errors are logged and surfaced in UI.
- Supervisor timeouts handled via scheduled jobs (Node cron or setTimeout).
- All writes are transactional (Prisma).
- Room events are always logged for audit/debug.

### Security & Auditability
- **Authentication/Authorization:** (Planned) JWT or session-based for admin/supervisor.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforced via Prisma schema, unique constraints, and transactional writes.
- **Audit Logs:** All room events, escalations, and supervisor actions are logged.
- **Environment Variables:** Secrets (DB, LiveKit) managed via `.env` and not committed.

### Extensibility & Scaling
- **Add new features:**
  - Backend: Add new service, route, or event handler.
  - Frontend: Add new component/page, update API calls.
- **Scale components:**
  - Backend and DB can be containerized and deployed independently.
  - LiveKit can be scaled via cloud or self-hosted clusters.
- **Multi-tenancy:**
  - Add tenantId to DB models, partition data by salon/client.
- **Analytics:**
  - Add event tracking, response time metrics, escalation rates.

# In a new terminal:
cd ../admin && npm start
```

---

## 4. Backend (API) Details

- **Framework:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Key Files:**
  - `src/app.ts`: Main server entry point
  - `src/routes/`: API endpoints (agent, supervisor, etc.)
  - `src/services/`: Business logic (agent, supervisor, knowledge base)
  - `src/models/`: Data models
  - `src/eventBus.ts`: Event-driven architecture for decoupling
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/agent/call`: Start a new call/session
  - `/api/agent/message`: Send/receive messages
  - `/api/help-requests`: CRUD for help requests
  - `/api/kb`: CRUD for knowledge base
  - `/api/room-events`: Room event logs

### Error Handling
- All endpoints use async error handlers
- Graceful fallback for database/network errors
- Supervisor timeouts handled via scheduled jobs

---

## 5. Frontend: Client App

- **Framework:** React 19, TypeScript
- **Key Features:**
  - Chat interface for salon customers
  - Real-time updates via LiveKit
  - Connection status, loading, and error states
  - Consistent styling with CSS classes (matches admin)
- **Key Files:**
  - `src/HelpRequest.tsx`: Main chat UI
  - `src/App.css`: Shared styles

### How It Works
- User enters their name/phone and starts a session
- Messages are sent to the backend and relayed via LiveKit
- If the AI cannot answer, it escalates to a supervisor
- User is notified when a supervisor responds

---

## 6. Frontend: Admin/Supervisor App

- **Framework:** React 19, TypeScript
- **Key Features:**
  - View/manage pending help requests
  - Submit answers to resolve requests
  - View history of resolved/unresolved requests
  - Manage knowledge base (add/delete answers)
  - View room events for auditing
- **Key Files:**
  - `src/PendingRequests.tsx`: Pending help requests
  - `src/LearnedAnswers.tsx`: Knowledge base management
  - `src/RoomEvents.tsx`: Room event logs

### Supervisor Workflow
1. See all pending help requests
2. Click "Reply" to answer a request
3. Answer is sent to the backend, which notifies the original caller
4. Supervisor can add or delete knowledge base entries

---

## 7. Database Schema & Migrations

- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Schema:** See `prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Key Tables:**
  - `HelpRequest`: Tracks all escalations (pending, resolved, unresolved)
  - `KnowledgeBaseEntry`: Stores learned answers
  - `RoomEvent`: Logs all LiveKit room events

### Example Schema (simplified)
```prisma
model HelpRequest {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  question  String
  callerId  String
  status    HelpRequestStatus
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  resolvedAt DateTime?
  supervisorResponse String?
  knowledgeBaseEntry KnowledgeBaseEntry? @relation(fields: [knowledgeBaseEntryId], references: [id])
  knowledgeBaseEntryId String? @unique
}

model KnowledgeBaseEntry {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  question  String
  answer    String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  source    String
  helpRequest HelpRequest?
}

model RoomEvent {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  roomName  String
  eventType String
  participantId String?
  participantName String?
  data      String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

## 8. LiveKit Integration

- **Purpose:** Real-time communication between client, agent, and supervisor
- **How Used:**
  - Each help session is a LiveKit room
  - Client and agent join the room for messaging
  - Room events (join, leave, message) are logged
- **Configuration:**
  - Set `LIVEKIT_WS_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` in `.env`
- **Agent Bot:**
  - Polls for new messages and responds in real time
  - Handles multiple rooms simultaneously
